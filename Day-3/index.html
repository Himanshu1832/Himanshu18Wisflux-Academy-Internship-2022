                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.

                    <li>
                      Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                      objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                      For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                      elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                      clicks, form input, and page navigation.

                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.</li></ul>

                    your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                additional objects; for example:
              </p>

                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                    more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                    provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
                    any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                    objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
